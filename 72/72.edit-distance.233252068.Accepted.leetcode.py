'''
	Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

	You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

	Insert a character
	Delete a character
	Replace a character
	Example 1:

	Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
	Output: 3
	Explanation: 
	horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
	rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
	rose -> ros (remove 'e')
	Example 2:

	Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
	Output: 5
	Explanation: 
	intention -> inention (remove 't')
	inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
	enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
	exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
	exection -> execution (insert 'u')
