Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/uncommon-words-from-two-sentences/

We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words. 
Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)
A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.
Return a list of all uncommon words. 
You may return the list in any order.

Example 1:
Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]

Example 2:
Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
 
Note:
0 <= A.length <= 200
0 <= B.length <= 200
A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
