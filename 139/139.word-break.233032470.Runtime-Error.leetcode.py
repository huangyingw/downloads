'''
	Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

	Note:

	The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
	You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
	Example 1:

	Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
	Output: true
	Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
