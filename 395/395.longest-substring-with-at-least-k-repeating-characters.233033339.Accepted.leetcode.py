'''
    Find the length of the longest substring T of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in T appears no less than k times.

    Example 1:

    Input:
    s = "aaabb", k = 3

    Output:
    3

    The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
    Example 2:

    Input:
    s = "ababbc", k = 2

    Output:
    5

    The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
