'''
Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in A.

Recall that a subsequence of A is a list A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k] with 0 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1, and that a sequence B is arithmetic if B[i+1] - B[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < B.length - 1).

 

Example 1:

Input: [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [9,4,7,2,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].
