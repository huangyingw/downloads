'''
	You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.

	Example 1:

	Input:
	  s = "barfoothefoobarman",
	  words = ["foo","bar"]
	Output: [0,9]
	Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
	The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
	Example 2:

	Input:
	  s = "wordgoodstudentgoodword",
	  words = ["word","student"]
	Output: []
