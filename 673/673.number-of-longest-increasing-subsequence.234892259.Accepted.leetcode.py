'''
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
Note: Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
