Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
peek() -- Get the front element.
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

Example:
MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();
queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false

Notes:
You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and 
is empty operations are valid.
Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque 
(double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
