Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, 
replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 
(where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 
Input: 19
Output: true

Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
