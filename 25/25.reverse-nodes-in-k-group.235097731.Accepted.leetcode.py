'''
    Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

    k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

    Example:

    Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

    For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

    For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
