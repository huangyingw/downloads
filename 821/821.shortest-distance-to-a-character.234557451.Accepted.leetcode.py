Given a string S and a character C, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character C in the string.

Example 1:
Input: S = "loveleetcode", C = 'e'
Output: [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0]
 

Note:
S string length is in [1, 10000].
C is a single character, and guaranteed to be in string S.
All letters in S and C are lowercase.
