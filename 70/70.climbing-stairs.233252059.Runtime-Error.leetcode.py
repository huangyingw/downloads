'''
	You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

	Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

	Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

	Example 1:

	Input: 2
	Output: 2
	Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
	1. 1 step + 1 step
	2. 2 steps
