Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]

Note:
Each element in the result must be unique.
The result can be in any order.
