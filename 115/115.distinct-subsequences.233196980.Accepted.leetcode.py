'''
    Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of S which equals T.

    A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

    Example 1:

    Input: S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:

    As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
    (The caret symbol ^ means the chosen letters)

    rabbbit
    ^^^^ ^^
    rabbbit
    ^^ ^^^^
    rabbbit
    ^^^ ^^^
