Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements 
of nums except nums[i].

Example:
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity 
analysis.)
