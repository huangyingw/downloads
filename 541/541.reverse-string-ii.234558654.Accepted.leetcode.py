Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string-ii/

Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the 
start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but 
greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

Example:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"

Restrictions:
The string consists of lower English letters only.
Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]
