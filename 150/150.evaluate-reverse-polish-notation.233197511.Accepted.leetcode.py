'''
    Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

    Valid operators are +, -, *, /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

    Note:

    Division between two integers should truncate toward zero.
    The given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result and there won't be any divide by zero operation.
    Example 1:

    Input: ["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]
    Output: 9
    Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9
    Example 2:

    Input: ["4", "13", "5", "/", "+"]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6
